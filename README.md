##RegressorHub
RegressorHub is a Python package for running logistic and linear regression models.

Next Steps
Hyperparameter Tuning
To improve the performance of your regression models, consider adding hyperparameter tuning. You can use libraries like scikit-learn's GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to search for the best hyperparameters automatically.

Adding WandB Logs
Integrate WandB (Weights and Biases) for comprehensive experiment tracking and visualization. You can log hyperparameters, model metrics, and other important information to gain insights into your regression experiments. To get started with WandB, follow their documentation at WandB Official Docs.
