#RegressorHub
RegressorHub is a Python package for running logistic and linear regression models.




##Next Steps
Some ideas for improving RegressorHub:

-Add hyperparameter tuning (grid search, random search)
-Log training with Weights & Biases
-Add more regression models (ridge, lasso, elasticnet, etc)
-Containerize with Docker for easy deployment
##Contributing
Contributions to add more regression models or improve documentation are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request.
